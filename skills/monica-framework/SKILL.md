# Monica Framework

Use this skill as the entry point for work on Monica itself: infrastructure modules, shared UI, framework documentation, requirements, and test conventions.

## Routing

- Module architecture, folder boundaries, Facades, Providers, public/internal placement, page decomposition: use `$monica-architecture`.
- Module registration, `Res` and `Res<T>`, services, Guide methods, hosted services, runtime module behavior: use `$monica-development`.
- Independent NuGet packages, publisher-first IDs, third-party module keys, compatibility branding, licensing, scaffolding, and publishing: use `$monica-third-party-module-development`.
- Blazor or MudBlazor implementation, CSS isolation, themes, browser storage: use `$monica-ui-development`.
- Monica UI localization/i18n resources, hardcoded user-facing text, UI registry keys, and localization validation: use `$monica-ui-localization`.
- UI concept design or interactive HTML prototypes before implementation: use `$monica-ui-design`.
- Theme-first component compliance and hardcoded-style audits: use `$monica-ui-audit`.
- Monica user documentation, module docs, guides, and zh-CN documentation: use `$monica-docs-authoring`.
- Requirement gathering and architecture planning for Monica modules: use `$monica-requirement-design`.
- OpenTelemetry-compatible meters, counters, histograms, gauges, diagnostic snapshots, or telemetry ownership: use `$monica-opentelemetry`.
- Monica unit-test layout, shared test infrastructure, xUnit, or bUnit conventions: use `$monica-unit-testing`.
- Bridge-based UI inspection through a runnable host: use `$monica-ui-bridge-debug`.

## Working Rule

Load only the granular skill that matches the active task. Combine skills when the task crosses boundaries, such as `$monica-architecture` plus `$monica-ui-development` for a new UI module.
