Monica is an agent-governed application architecture for observable .NET backends. It gives developers and coding agents the same typed vocabulary for modules, DDD application units, infrastructure, and runtime diagnostics—so generated code remains structurally predictable and the running system remains understandable.

> Monica is approaching 1.0 and is still allowed to make breaking architectural improvements before the stable release.

## Why Monica

- **A graph, not startup glue.** `AddMonica(...)` records the complete module graph for one host, validates dependencies and cycles, then applies registrations in deterministic phases.
- **A vocabulary agents can follow.** ProjectUnits describe application services, domain services, entities, repositories, events, handlers, configurations, and jobs as explicit architectural roles.
- **Inspectable by default.** Operational modules expose the same graph, configuration, jobs, telemetry, and application structure that produced the running process.
- **Host-scoped state.** A Monica composition belongs to its host. Multiple hosts in one process do not share module registries, options, mapping rules, or ProjectUnit catalogs.

## Start in one minute

Install only the packages used by your application:

```bash
dotnet add package Monica.ProjectUnits --prerelease
dotnet add package Monica.JobScheduler --prerelease
dotnet add package Monica.JobScheduler.UI --prerelease
```

Compose the host in one bounded callback:

```csharp
using Monica.Core.Modularity.Extensions;
using Monica.Modules;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddMonica(monica =>
{
    monica.ConfigureApplication(options =>
    {
        options.AppName = "Orders";
        options.AppId = "orders";
    });

    monica.ConfigureModuleSystem(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultApiGroupName = "Orders";
    });

    monica.AddProjectUnits(options =>
    {
        options.ConventionOptions.EnableNameConvention = true;
    });

    monica.AddJobScheduler(options =>
        {
            options.ProjectName = "Orders";
        })
        .UseSchedulerScope("orders")
        .UseInMemoryStore();

    monica.AddJobSchedulerUI();
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseMonica();
app.MapMonica();
app.Run();
```

With a durable production store, execution leases provide at-least-once recovery after a worker crash, while fencing rejects mutations from an expired lease. Each host synchronizes, schedules, and executes the jobs it discovers under its own owner identity; replicas coordinate through durable compare-and-swap operations. Concurrency gates are keyed by scheduler scope, owner, and `JobKey`. Fencing cannot make arbitrary job side effects exactly-once, so jobs should use idempotency keys or transactional business boundaries for those effects.

The callback is the complete composition boundary. Captured `ModuleRegistration<,>` handles cannot mutate the graph after it closes, and startup fails early when the graph is incomplete or cyclic.

For a runnable DDD application rather than a toy snippet, see [`examples/Monica.ReferenceApplication`](examples/Monica.ReferenceApplication). For the smallest operational scheduler UI host, see [`examples/JobSchedulerMinimal`](examples/JobSchedulerMinimal).

## The architecture contract

Every module follows the same public shape:

- `Module{Name} : MonicaModule<Module{Name}Option>` — the host-owned lifecycle strategy.
- `Module{Name}Option : ModuleOptions<Module{Name}>` — startup-frozen configuration and defaults.
- `Module{Name}BuilderExtensions` — the discoverable `monica.Add{Name}()` entry point, returning a host-bound `ModuleRegistration<,>`.
- `Module{Name}RegistrationExtensions` — optional provider and capability choices that enrich that registration.

The strategy declares hard dependencies and optional ordering in `Describe(ModuleDescriptor)`. It reads its own finalized `Option` directly and can read another module's options only through one of those declared relationships. Business-type work is declared once through `DeclareTypeDiscovery(...)`; Monica combines non-empty structural queries into one type-universe scan and commits matches serially in graph order.

ProjectUnits add the application vocabulary:

`ApplicationService` · `RequestDto` · `DomainService` · `Entity` · `Repository` · `DomainEvent` · `DomainEventHandler` · `LocalEventHandler` · `Configuration` · `RecurringJob` · `TriggeredJob`

Each discovered unit can also carry explicit agent context and requirement traceability:

```csharp
[ProjectUnitMetadata(
    "Approve Order",
    Owner = "Ordering Team",
    Description = "Approves an eligible order.",
    Tags = ["ordering", "approval"])]
[ProjectUnitRequirement("ORD-REQ-001")]
public sealed class CommandHandlerApproveOrder : ApplicationService<CommandApproveOrder>
{
    // ...
}
```

`Monica.Framework.UI` exposes a first-tab status dashboard for the current host with unit distribution, dependency health, alerts, and independent metadata, description, ownership, and requirement coverage. The typed `/framework/units`, `/framework/units/dashboard`, and `/framework/units/{key}` APIs expose the same catalog without leaking reflection objects.

## Module diagnostics

Hosts opt in with `monica.AddModuleSystem()`. Its `ModuleDiagnosticsFacade` exposes one immutable, revisioned snapshot of composition outcome, timings, callbacks, startup work, type-discovery stages, findings, and direct dependency topology. Assembly inventory is lazy, option diagnostics are loaded separately, and portable exports omit option data, assembly paths, stack traces, and raw exception details. `monica.AddModuleSystemUI()` includes the Core diagnostics module automatically.

Every public module-option property remains visible by clean type name. Ordinary bounded values are shown automatically; `[ModuleOptionDiagnosticsSensitive]` or a host policy reduces sensitive content to a non-secret presence, count, or protected-address representation as appropriate. `RevealSensitive` can reveal only bounded sensitive scalars and is restricted to Development-only debugging. The Module System workbench is also Development-only by default; exposing it elsewhere requires both explicit enablement and a host authorization policy.

The canonical Monica-owned Agent Skills live under [`skills/`](skills/). Release tooling projects each managed Monica skill byte-for-byte into `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` for repository-local discovery while preserving unrelated external skills; those managed projections are not authoring sources. Start with `monica-guide` for setup and diagnostics, then continue through the profile-selected `monica-application`, `monica-framework`, and granular skills.

## Third-party ecosystem

Independent packages use the publisher-first ID `<Publisher>.Monica.<Package>[.<Variant>]`; one NuGet package may contain any coherent number of infrastructure, provider, web, and UI modules. The official `Monica.*` prefix and purple logo remain reserved for first-party packages.

Start with the [`monica-third-party-module-development`](skills/monica-third-party-module-development) skill to scaffold, validate, test, pack, and publish an independent package. The compatibility identity and usage rules are summarized in [BRANDING.md](BRANDING.md), with the complete bilingual guide in [Monica.Docs](https://monica.dpdns.org/).

## Package maturity

The maturity label describes the compatibility promise, not package quality.

| Tier | Promise | Representative packages |
|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | The supported 1.0 application path | Core, ProjectUnits, WebApi, Configuration, Repository, JobScheduler, OpenTelemetry, UI |
| **Integrations** | Versioned adapters around external systems | EF Core, Kafka, Redis/StackExchange, Dapr, SignalR |
| **Labs** | Deliberately fast-moving exploration | AI/RAG/MCP, DataChannel, DevOps and profiling, Office, Experimental |

Applications can adopt Stable without taking a dependency on Labs. Integration packages remain optional and provider-specific; CI validates both complete package classification and one-way maturity dependencies.

## Runtime surfaces

Monica includes operational Blazor surfaces for module dependencies, ProjectUnits, configuration, jobs, dependency injection, telemetry, repositories, and other registered capabilities. They share a theme contract and first-party `en-US` and `zh-CN` localization resources.

The one-minute demo shows JobScheduler operations, module dependency inspection, and runtime configuration:
